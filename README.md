# Monkey See Monkey Do (MSMD)
A blinks party game for 1 or more players. The more blinks you have, the more players it will support.

The aim of the game is to follow the instructions displayed on your blinks as quickly as possible. Too slow, and you'll lose a life. The first player/team to lose all their lives loses. The winners get a banana![^1]


### Setup

MSMD can support a number of different players at different skill levels. For your first play, start with 3 blinks in a row pointing away from you. They should be coloured Green at either end, with blue connections displayed on the one in between.

Double click the green blink furthest from you, this will make it the controller and it should turn magenta and start pulsing - your game has started!

The green blink nearest you will start to flash a pattern, which will tell you what action you need to take with the blink.


### Actions
###### Magenta, Rotating Clockwise - Turn the blink 1 step clockwise

###### Magenta, Rotating Anti-Clockwise - Turn the blink 1 step clockwise

###### Yellow, Moving Away from the connected blink - Turn the blink 180 degrees

###### Blue, flashing half and half - Click the blink twice

###### Blue, flashing third and third and third - Click the blink three times

If you do the wrong action, you will lose a life, and a red segment will be filled in on the connecting blink. When the connecting blink is full, the next life lost will fill in a segment on the next blink towards the controller. If that blink is the controller, than the game is over and you have lost.

### Fireworks
After you have been playing for a while, the controller may start pulsing red. Watch out, fireworks are about to happen! When it stops pulsing red, fireworks will launch and scare the monkeys. Your blink will ask for a number of instructions in rapid succession, try and complete them all without losing a life!

Once you are used to the instructions, try playing whilst controlling two blinks, in this configuration:

There are lots of different configurations you can use to play with other people, there are some suggested below. If you are playing with people of different skill levels or levels of ability, you can add additional blinks between theirs and the controller to give them an extra six lives for each one. For example, when playing with my kids, my youngest only has one blink whilst my eldest controls two, but has an extra 6 lives. We find this leads to close games as it accounts for each of our abilities.

Feel free to add in extra rules for forfits, or if you want it to be really tough - play one handed!
